# Research Proposal
*Research Question: In what ways do Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) mitigate gentrification and displacement risks in Southbay and Long Beach?*
 
**Significance**
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected the way we go about everyday life. From the permanent closure of businesses to the record-setting number of Americans that have filed for unemployment, individuals are at a greater risk of gentrification and displacement. In Los Angeles County, roughly 400,000 renter households are at risk of homelessness and evictions (Blasi, 2020) because of COVID-19 and the lack of rent protections enacted. These current rent pressures are all tied into displacement and developer reinvestment similar to the Housing Crisis of 2006. 

Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) are secondary units that provide additional, more affordable housing to the public. They have always existed in the form of illegal garage conversions or unpermitted additions; it wasn't until 2018 that the State of California adopted ordinances that legalized ADU’s. ADUs have the potential to become a viable source of affordable housing; however, there are many issues that exist with these types of development. From fiscal issues of permitting and constructing to the lack of protections in place for renters, we question whether ADUs combat or assist in the gentrification and displacement of neighborhoods. Personally, we have had first hand experiences living in ADUs that lacked proper protections in place, during our graduate career. This project will allow us to understand the phenomena of ADUs in the Los Angeles region from a data-driven viewpoint and how they have impacted the general community. 

**Case Study Locations**
The spatial time of economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic is important because it pushes the need for housing affordability. ADU’s can prove to be a viable, effective method to addressing the ongoing housing crisis. In order to analyze the impacts of ADUs, this project will performa comparative analysis between two case studies: Long Beach and the South Bay*. We are interested in examining the impact of ADUs in lower-income communities to further understand its potential for vulnerable BIPOC communities that are currently experiencing high rent burden and high gentrification risk. These analyses will play an important role in developing some foundational reports for our long-term client project.
 
* We intend to choose a specific city within the South Bay; however, we don’t really know what data is available out there for each city. Having worked as a Planning Technician for the City of Gardena, many South Bay Cities do not have information on ADUs readily available. 

**Intended Analysis & Data Source**
One of the primary components for this project is to simply track where ADUs are located. We will reach out to the local jurisdictions and gather information on the number of permits issued as well as their location; we will also reach out to the Code Enforcement Divisions for any citations on unpermitted units and if possible their locations. There is still the possibility that there are unpermitted units without citations; thus, we will cross examine data from the Census and the County Assessor. Any discrepancies between the number of units reported on the Census to what is recorded by the Assessor will notify us of potential ADUs existing within the given sites.  After this assessment, we will do a cross examination with our self-created data of ADU listings on Craiglist and Facebook Marketplace to be able to possibly confirm our initial data collection. It is assumed that since these ADUs are unpermitted, they are more likely to be listed on sites like Craigslist and Facebook where landlords themselves can upload without having to provide any documentation.

Aftering mapping out these ADUs we would want to overlay it on the gentrification risk data from Center for Neighborhood Knowledge to determine if there is any correlation between the two statistical variables. From there, we can determine if ADUs have any relationship with gentrification and displacement to decide what additional data may be needed for further analysis. As a supplemental assessment, overlaying the ADU data with COVID-19 impact data will help show the relationship between rent impact during the pandemic and ADUs’ possible gentrification and displacement mitigations.

**Hypothesis**
Through this project, we are hoping to gain a better understanding of how ADUs may or may not be a good short-term solution to address the current housing issue (lack of affordable housing and high gentrification risks). This will help provide us further insight in whether the legalization of these ADUs should be implemented to provide more renter protections for these affordable housing units. And if legalized, what pathways will be best to ensure affordability is the main concern being addressed. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that there will be an abundance of ADUs in our case study sites advertised in informal markets for families to build passive income. We also predict that ADUs will have a positive impact on mitigating gentrification and displacement risks during regular conditions and COVID-19.
