**Paragraph 1: What spoke to you?**

“Off the Grid… and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design” by Geoff Boeing is an interesting paper on exploring how OSMnx can be a spatial analysis tool to examine the street network patterns of various regions such as Portland, San Francisco, and Rome). What spoke to me was that different street networks can link to different historical eras, planning regimes, design paradigms, and topographies which shows how planning cities have long term consequences. The figure-ground map especially stood out to me because it helped visualize the street network patterns for different geographical regions. This is something I would be interested in mapping and creating on the side to just learn the processes of OSMnx. Overall, these maps are really helpful to understand spatial patterns and it showed me a different way to map because I initially learned how to build figure-ground maps through Illustrator but OSMnx would most likely provide more precise coordinates.

**Paragraph 2: How does it inform your approach to your own research?**

This paper mentioned how OSMnx has its advantages in being able to efficiently provide data on the physical features of the built environment. However, the data does not portray the quality of the pedestrian level analysis. Based on this information, I think about the importance of integrating the concepts of landscape literacy, which is the effort to understand the community and built environment on multiple levels to create a comprehensive report. This all relates to my research because data on ADUs will be limited due to COVID-19, etc., so then we have to become creative in how we reach out to the community to understand what is happening on a neighborhood level. We were planning to look into the discrete advertisements of ADUs on different online marketplaces to tap into a hidden network of ADUs. I think OpenStreetMap can play role in helping us understand the density and clustering of ADUs per block, intersection, or street grid.

**Questions**

    1. Are there any other explorative methods you have used to test OSMnx capabilities beyond your street/node analysis report?
    
    2. In what ways can these mapping tools be used to uplift on-the-ground community planning with residents and stakeholders?
